            <h2>taylor.collecting</h3>
            <p>starting or upgrading your taylor CD collection? i've collected (probably) every taylor cd released so far and put all of them here! have fun looking</p>
            <h2>about me</h2>
            <p>hi! i'm a new swiftie, became one after the announcement of 1989 tv (before release). either way, here's some facts about me!</p>
            <p>top 5:</p>
            <li>1. folklore (favorite song: the 1)</li>
            <li>2. Midnights (favorite song: Maroon)</li>
            <li>3. 1989 tv (favorite song: Wildest Dreams)</li>
            <li>4. Lover (favorite song: Paper Rings & ME! (sorry not sorry))</li>
            <li>5. evermore (favorite song: right where you left me)</li>
            <h2>can this website get a domain?</h2>
            <p>nahh, i can't afford a domain (domain is for example google.com) for a small personal project lol. but i think github is a great place to share this website, i can show all the source code and keep it tidy, without having to pay for cloud or service fees.</p>
            <h2>who are you?</h2>
            <p>i'm an anonymous swiftie, my username is anonswift or anonynswift. my only true account is <a href="https://reddit.com/u/anonynswift">u/anonynswift</a></p>
            <h2>how do i look with this site?</h2>
            <p>ah, just click on an album then look throughout the category: album, single, ep, etc. once you find what you want, click on the discogs button. there, you'll find more details and you can check the barcode. once you're happy, place an order with discogs or look through some other marketplace or store! or just browse, lol.</p>
            <h2>! notes !</h2>
            <p>the low, median and high price may be incorrect. i used the prices shown on discogs, so it's most likely wrong. next up, there's only the US or the most popular international version CDs, it'd take a long time to put in all versions (there's SO MANY)</p>
